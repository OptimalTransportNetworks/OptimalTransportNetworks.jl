# using Plots

function patchline(xs, ys, zs, args...)
    # Plot lines as patches (efficiently)
    #
    # SYNTAX:
    #     patchline(xs,ys)
    #     patchline(xs,ys,zs,...)
    #     patchline(xs,ys,zs,'PropertyName',propertyvalue,...)
    #     p = patchline(...)
    #
    # PROPERTIES: 
    #     Accepts all parameter-values accepted by PATCH.
    # 
    # DESCRIPTION:
    #     p = patchline(xs,ys,zs,'PropertyName',propertyvalue,...)
    #         Takes a vector of x-values (xs) and a same-sized
    #         vector of y-values (ys). z-values (zs) are
    #         supported, but optional; if specified, zs must
    #         occupy the third input position. Takes all P-V
    #         pairs supported by PATCH. Returns in p the handle
    #         to the resulting patch object.
    #         
    # NOTES:
    #     Note that we are drawing 0-thickness patches here,
    #     represented only by their edges. FACE PROPERTIES WILL
    #     NOT NOTICEABLY AFFECT THESE OBJECTS! (Modify the
    #     properties of the edges instead.)
    #
    #     LINUX (UNIX) USERS: One test-user found that this code
    #     worked well on his Windows machine, but crashed his
    #     Linux box. We traced the problem to an openGL issue;
    #     the problem can be fixed by calling 'opengl software'
    #     in your <http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/startup.html startup.m>.
    #     (That command is valid at startup, but not at runtime,
    #     on a unix machine.)
    #
    # EXAMPLES:
    #%% Example 1:
    #
    # n = 10;
    # xs = rand(n,1);
    # ys = rand(n,1);
    # zs = rand(n,1)*3;
    # plot3(xs,ys,zs,'r.')
    # xlabel('x');ylabel('y');zlabel('z');
    # p  = patchline(xs,ys,zs,'linestyle','--','edgecolor','g',...
    #     'linewidth',3,'edgealpha',0.2);
    #
    #%% Example 2: (Note "hold on" not necessary here!)
    #
    # t = 0:pi/64:4*pi;
    # p(1) = patchline(t,sin(t),'edgecolor','b','linewidth',2,'edgealpha',0.5);
    # p(2) = patchline(t,cos(t),'edgecolor','r','linewidth',2,'edgealpha',0.5);
    # l = legend('sine(t)','cosine(t)');
    # tmp = sort(findobj(l,'type','patch'));
    # for ii = 1:numel(tmp)
    #     set(tmp(ii),'facecolor',get(p(ii),'edgecolor'),'facealpha',get(p(ii),'edgealpha'),'edgecolor','none')
    # end
    #
    #%% Example 3 (requires Image Processing Toolbox):
    #%%   (NOTE that this is NOT the same as showing a transparent image on 
    #%%         of the existing image. (That functionality is
    #%%         available using showMaskAsOverlay or imoverlay).
    #%%         Instead, patchline plots transparent lines over
    #%%         the image.)
    #
    # img = imread('rice.png');
    # imshow(img)
    # img = imtophat(img,strel('disk',15));
    # grains = im2bw(img,graythresh(img));
    # grains = bwareaopen(grains,10);
    # edges = edge(grains,'canny');
    # boundaries = bwboundaries(edges,'noholes');
    # cmap = jet(numel(boundaries));
    # ind = randperm(numel(boundaries));
    # for ii = 1:numel(boundaries)
    # patchline(boundaries{ii}(:,2),boundaries{ii}(:,1),...
    #     'edgealpha',0.2,'edgecolor',cmap(ind(ii),:),'linewidth',3);
    # end

# Please note that this is a rough translation and may not work as expected due to differences in how Matlab and Julia handle plotting and graphics. The `setproperty!` function used in the code is a placeholder and should be replaced with the appropriate function or method to set properties of the plot object in Julia. The `plot` function from the `Plots` package is used here, but you may need to adjust this depending on the specific plotting package you are using in Julia.
