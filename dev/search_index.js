D., & Schaal, E. (2020). Optimal transport networks in spatial equilibrium. Econometrica, 88(4), 1411-1452.\n\nThe library is based on the JuMP modeling framework for mathematical optimization in Julia, and roughly follows the  MATLAB OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox (v1.0.4b) provided by the authors. Compared to MATLAB, the Julia library presents a simplified interface and only exports key functions, while retaining full flexibility. \n\nExported Functions\n\nProblem Setup\n\ninit_paramaters()   - Create parameters dictionary\n\ncreate_graph()      - Create network graph dictionary\n\napply_geography()   - (Optional) apply geographical features to alter the graph edge weights (network building and traversing costs)\n\nCompute Optimal Network + Refine Solution in Non-Convex Cases\n\noptimal_network()   - Compute optimal network given parameters and graph. Can also be used to just solve the model on a given network. \n\nannealing()         - Refine solution using simulated annealing in non-convex cases (automatically called in optimal_network() if param[:annealing] == true))\n\nPlot Graph (Incl.

This has proven ineffective for dual solutions to the model where the objective is quite complex. Thus, at present, duality does not help to speed up computations in Julia, and accordingly the default is duality = false. I expect this to change in when support for detecting nonlinear subexpressions will be added to JuMP.  \nSymbolic autodifferentiation via MathOptSymbolicAD.jl can provide significant performance improvements.
