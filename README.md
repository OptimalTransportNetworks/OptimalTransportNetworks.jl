Which applies duality principles to derive the optimal transport network (extenstion) from any primitive set of economic fundamantals (population, productivity, endowments of traded/non-traded goods, and/or a pre-existing transport network) - a pathbraking contribution in quantitative spatial economics instrumental for the economic planning of transport infrastructure.
