**Optimal Transport Networks in Spatial Equilibrium - in Julia**

Julia translation of the Matlab OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox v1.0.4 implementing the quantitative spatial economic model of

Fajgelbaum, P. D., & Schaal, E. (2020). Optimal transport networks in spatial equilibrium. *Econometrica, 88*(4), 1411-1452.

The model/software uses duality principles to optimize over the space of networks, nesting an optimal flows problem and a neoclasical general-equilibrium trade model into a global network design problem to derive the optimal transport network (extension) from any primitive set of economic fundamantals (population, productivity, endowments of traded/non-traded goods, and/or a pre-existing transport network) - A pathbraking contribution in quantitative spatial economics instrumental for the economic planning of transport infrastructure.
